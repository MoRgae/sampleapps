# Sample Apps

This repo contains sample apps that showcase how Translators can be used to interact with similar devices using a common schema.

The alpha version provides samples for Windows UWP (C#), Android (Java), Azure IoT Hub, AWS Kinesis, and JavaScript/Node. We would love to work with  the community to add sample apps for other platforms and frameworks such as Xamarin, Cordova, Swift and for other clouds environments such as Google Cloud.
