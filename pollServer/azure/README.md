# Deploy to Azure
There are multiple options to run the pollServer app on Azure:
* VM (both Windows and Linux)
* Worker or Web Role

The app can also be easily imported in Visual Studio tools for Node.js and use the built-in deploy feature to upload the code to Azure.
Please refer to Azure documentation for the detailed instructions on how to deploy the app. Once the bits are copied on the server, `npm install` needs to be executed in order to download all dependencies.
